# GD-LRU Readme
This folder contains a markdown (and pdf) file of my solution the the third question. The approach I took is based on a quick literature review and personal experience. As might be apparent, I'm not an experienced DBA, but I did work with dockerized MongoDB instances and found them a pleasure to work with.

Furthermore, the lru.py file demonstrates how I would implement an LRU based on the above architecture. The example is based on an exercise available at: https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/submissions/
